title: Post an event
excerpt: >-
  When something happens in one of your engineering systems that may have an
  impact on your cloud costs, submit an `Event` to the CloudZero API to
  correlate the `Event` with your ongoing cloud costs. For example, you can send
  us an `Event` every time you do a deployment. CloudZero will then correlate
  those deployment `Event`s with changing cloud costs to help you understand
  what is driving said costs in any given period of time.
