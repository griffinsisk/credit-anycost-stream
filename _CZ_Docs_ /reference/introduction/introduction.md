The CloudZero API V2 is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON request bodies, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP methods, headers, response codes, and authentication.

The following sections apply to the V2 APIs:

- [Authorization](ref:authorization) (also applies to V1 APIs)
- [Filtering](ref:filtering)
- [Idempotency](ref:idempotency)
- [Pagination](ref:pagination)
- [Sorting](ref:sorting)
- [Testing](ref:testing)
