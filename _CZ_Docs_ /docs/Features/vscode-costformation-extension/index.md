The CloudZero CostFormation Toolkit, available for the [Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor](https://code.visualstudio.com), is provided to support your work in authoring your CostFormation definitions. The Toolkit is an extension for the VS Code editor that provides capabilities specific to the authoring of Custom Dimensions and is integrated with the CloudZero platform to enable full end-to end-management of your CostFormation definitions.

The CostFormation Definition Language allows you to create Custom Dimensions using rules that break down your cloud spend in ways that best align with your business and technical needs.
