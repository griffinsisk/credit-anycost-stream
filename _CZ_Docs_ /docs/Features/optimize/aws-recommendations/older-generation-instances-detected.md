The Amazon EC2, RDS, and ElastiCache services continually upgrade their instances to the current generation. Older generation instances may be less efficient and more costly to you. Periodically check your environments for older generation instances for opportunities to upgrade to the AWS current generation to improve performance and reduce cost. Generally you can save up to 15% of the cost of your older generation instances by upgrading them.

**Threshold**: This Recommendation is created if the total real cost spend for the identified Amazon EC2, RDS, and ElastiCache older generation instances is at least $500 and will be marked as **Addressed** afterwards when it falls below $500.
