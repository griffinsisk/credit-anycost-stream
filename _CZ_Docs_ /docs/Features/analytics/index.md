CloudZero’s [Analytics](https://app.cloudzero.com/analytics/dashboards) feature automates the delivery of cloud cost intelligence. Analytics enables CloudZero customers to view, share, and act on their cost data with [Dashboards](#introduction-to-dashboards). Analytics are provided for 13 months of data, the most recent 12 months plus the current month.

# Introduction to Dashboards

A dashboard is a collection of one or more saved queries, displayed as visualization or text tiles together on one page. Dashboards can be standard (created by CloudZero) or custom (created by the user).

Dashboards have two types of visibility:

* A private Dashboard is visible only to its creator. Only users with the necessary permissions can create and view private Dashboards.
* A public Dashboard is visible to everyone in an organization.

# Viewing Dashboards

The [Analytics](https://app.cloudzero.com/analytics/dashboards) page lists all public Dashboards as well as private Dashboards you have created (if you have the necessary permissions).

Use the **search box** at the top of the page to find the Dashboard you are looking for.

Mark the Dashboards most important to you as **favorites**. Filter the list of Dashboards by **favorites** or by **visibility**, and **sort** by any column.

# Scheduling delivery of a Dashboard

All user roles can schedule Dashboards to be delivered by email.

1. Open the Dashboard you wish to schedule.

2. Click the **three dots** at the top right of the Dashboard to open the menu. Select **Schedule Delivery**.

3. Enter the **options** to schedule recurring Dashboard delivery on a regular basis.

# Filtering a Dashboard

The filters for a Dashboard appear directly under the Dashboard title. Make selections within the available filters, reload the Dashboard, and watch the data in the visualizations change.
