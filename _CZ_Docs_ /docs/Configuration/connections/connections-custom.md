# How a Custom Connection works

Using a custom [AnyCost Adaptor](/docs/anycost), the CloudZero platform can receive any cost data that you can transform into the [Common Bill Format](/docs/anycost-common-bill-format-cbf).

Creating a custom AnyCost Connection tells CloudZero how to access cost data using your AnyCost Adaptor. It also allows the platform to show those costs alongside other Cost Sources in the Explorer and enable anomaly alerts for the cost data.

# How to Create an AnyCost Connection

CloudZero supports two types of AnyCost Adaptor. For an overview of each, see [AnyCost Adaptor Types](/docs/anycost#adaptor-types).

To learn how create an AnyCost connection for your chosen AnyCost Adaptor type, see the following documentation:

* [Connect an AnyCost Bucket Adaptor](/docs/anycost-bucket-getting-started)
* [Connect an AnyCost Stream Adaptor](/docs/anycost-stream-getting-started)
