CloudZero provides role-based access control (RBAC) to create and manage roles that both restrict access to data AND govern the capabilities users can take action on.

New customers start with a Default Role, where they can assign and remove users, that allows them to set up RBAC. The first user or users can then start customizing new Roles and modify the Default Role as needed.

Refer to the documentation to see how to use the features of RBAC and the differences between RBAC and the legacy CloudZero roles.
