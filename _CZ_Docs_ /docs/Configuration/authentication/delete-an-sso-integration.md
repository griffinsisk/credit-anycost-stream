If you have the permissions needed to delete an SSO integration, you can delete an SSO connection by following these steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **SSO Integrations**.
2. Click the **trash can icon** next to the SSO integration.
3. When the following warning opens: **Before deleting this integration, ensure you have another active SSO connection or you may lose access to your platform**, determine if there are any users who did not previously configure a manual username and password. If so, these users will lose access to CloudZero if you continue.  
   <Callout icon="ℹ️">
     Users who previously had a username and password set up will be able to use those login credentials after the SSO connection has been deleted.
   </Callout>
4. When you are certain no users will lose access, click **Delete**.
